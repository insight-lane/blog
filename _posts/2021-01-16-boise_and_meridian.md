title: New cities! Boise and Meridian, ID
author: ben_batorsky

Thanks to the hard work of volunteer Eric Huang, we now have crash data and risk predictions for the cities of [Boise](https://insightlane.org/showcase/?city=boise) and [Meridian](https://insightlane.org/showcase/?city=meridian) in Idaho.

It's really exciting to see a new city on the platform and one pretty different from some of the other cities we've seen.

And what's more encouraging is how quickly Eric was able to get on board with the project.  Definitely reach out if you're interested in having your city onboarded!
