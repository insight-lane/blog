title: New city - New York

Thanks to our team member Sam Bail, we now have the mighty NYC included in our showcase.  This was a bit of a tricky one since we have crash data going back to 2012.  If we include ALL of these data, we essentially have a crash on almost every street segment.  That leads to an issue of [imbalanced classes](https://machinelearningmastery.com/what-is-imbalanced-classification/) in our risk prediction.  The result is that the algorithm essentially predicts ALL segments as high risk.

I reduced the number of years to the past 5, but STILL am seeing pretty high risk scores out of the model.  Comparing the distribution of scores for Boston versus NYC:

You can see that on average the risk scores for NYC are higher.  They're also less smooth, which might be a product of the limited featureset being used in NYC (vs Boston).  Likely we need some more detailed features to make the risk more usable.
